### Group Income

[Group Income](https://groupincome.org) is voluntary decentralized Basic Income for you and your friends. It uses Shelter Protocol to protect user data. Shelter Protocol was created as a way of meeting Group Income's [design requirements](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I381R5_joLE&list=PLRcgABNc9s2R3gSfRG7jHzb4giQdxaDB7&index=3), and now you can build apps like Group Income too!
