description: "Server API for the Shelter Protocol"
---

In a Shelter Protocol app, the server component is the simplest part of the system, containing the least amount of code, as most logic is stored on the client. However, some server API is needed to enable specific features:

- Writing and reading contract chains
- File attachments
- Registering usernames
- Features related to the [zero-knowledge password protocol](/en/zkpp)
- Subscribing to events via WebSocket
- Secure key-value store

This page describes those APIs.

## Writing & Reading Contracts

### /event

`POST /event`

API writing the JSON of an [`SPMessage`](/en/spmessage) to end of a contract (or creating a new contract). The body is just the JSON of the `SPMessage`.

If there is a conflict, returns HTTP Status `409 <latestHEAD> <height>`, if a message with the same `previousHEAD` already exists in the chain. Includes both the latest message hash and message height so that we can immediately reconstruct and [resend the message](/en/spmessage#resending-messages).

### /eventsAfter

`GET /eventsAfter/{contractID}/{since}`

NOTE: when synchronizing a contract, clients should call [`GET /latestHash`](#latesthash) to get the latest hash of a `contractID` and verify that at least one of the messages returned by this API has a hash equal to the hash returned by `/latestHash/{contractID}`.

### /eventsBefore

`GET /eventsBefore/{before}/{limit}`

### /eventsBetween

`GET /eventsBetween/{startHash}/{endHash}`

### /latestHash

`GET /latestHash/{contractID}`

### /time

`GET /time`

Returns the server's time as an [ISO String](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/toISOString). Very important for ensuring clients use synchornized timestamps on messages.

## File Attachments

### /file

`POST /file`

### /file/{hash}

`GET /file/{hash}`

## Username Registration

### /name

`POST /name`

### /name/{name}

`GET /name/{name}`

## Zero-knowledge Password Protocol

See [ZKPP](/en/zkpp) documentation for details.

### /zkpp/register/{contract}

`POST /zkpp/register/{contract}`

### /zkpp/{contract}/auth_hash

`GET /zkpp/{contract}/auth_hash`

### /zkpp/{contract}/contract_hash

`GET /zkpp/{contract}/contract_hash`

### /zkpp/updatePasswordHash/{contract}

`POST /zkpp/updatePasswordHash/{contract}`

## WebSocket API

The server runs a [WebSocket](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API) for broadcasting new [messages](/en/spmessage) to interested clients.

Messages sent between client & server are JSON objects with a `type` attribute. Note that [messages](/en/spmessage) are broadcast from the client to the server using the RESTful API [`POST /event`](#event), not via WebSocket.

```js
{ "type": TYPE, ... }
```

We'll categorize messages by type and whether they are sent by the client or server:

### Client: 'sub'

```json
{ "type": "sub", "contractID": "<contractID>", "dontBroadcast": true | false }
```

Client subscribes to a contract for subsequent [`"entry"`](#server-entry) events.

### Client: 'unsub'

```json
{ "type": "sub", "contractID": "<contractID>", "dontBroadcast": true | false }
```

### Client: 'pong'

```json
{ "type": "pong", "data": "<copy-of-server-ping-data>" }
```

Client responds to server `"ping"` by echoing `"data"` back to it.

### Server: 'sub'

```json
{ "type": "sub", "data": { "contractID": "<contractID>", "socketID": "<socketID>" } }
```

Server notifies clients already subscribed to `"contractID"` of a new subscriber, if they did not specify `"dontBroadcast": true`.

### Server: 'unsub'

```json
{ "type": "unsub", "data": { "contractID": "<contractID>", "socketID": "<socketID>" } }
```

Server notifies clients already subscribed to `"contractID"` of an unsubscriber, if they did not specify `"dontBroadcast": true`.

### Server: 'entry'

```json
{ "type": "entry", "data": "<spmessage-json>" }
```

Server broadcasts an [`SPMessage`](/en/spmessage) to subscribers of a contract.

### Server: 'success'

```json
{ "type": "success", "data": { "type": "sub" | "unsub", "contractID": "<contractID>" } }
```

Server response to client's request to subscribe or unsubscribe to a `"contractID"` upon success, includes a copy of the data the client sent.

### Server: 'error'

```json
{ "type": "error", "data": { "type": "sub" | "unsub", "contractID": "<contractID>" } }
```

Server response to client's request to subscribe or unsubscribe to a `"contractID"` upon failure, includes a copy of the data the client sent.

### Server: 'ping'

```json
{ "type": "ping", "data": <unix-ms> }
```

Server sends ping to clients so that they can detect connection issues. `"data"` contains value returned by [`Date.now()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/now).

## Secure Key-Value Store

All server data, including contracts and files, are stored in a key-value store. Shelter Protocol provides an API for directly interacting with this key-value store in a secure way. For example, you might want to restrict some keys from being written to, or read from, to specific entities or groups.

Coming soon.
