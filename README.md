Feel free to check [Astro's documentation](https://docs.astro.build) and [Starlight theme documentation](https://starlight.astro.build/getting-started/).

## Customize This Theme

### Site metadata

`src/consts.ts` contains several data objects that describe metadata about your site like title, description, default language, and Open Graph details. You can customize these to match your project.

## Page metadata

Astro uses frontmatter in Markdown pages to choose layouts and pass properties to those layouts. If you are using the default layout, you can customize the page in many different ways to optimize SEO and other things. For example, you can use the `title` and `description` properties to set the document title, meta title, meta description, and Open Graph description.

```markdown
---
title: Example title
description: Really cool docs example that uses Astro
---

# Page content...
```
